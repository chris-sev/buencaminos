						<p><b>He said:</b> Every girl dreams of getting married one day. Boys don't really know what they want in life. My life was a little bit different. I have always had a plan laid out in front of me.</p>
						<p>Before I met this girl I thought life was great. But under circumstances it all fell apart for me. My goals in life shifted priorities. Marriage was out of the equation. I built this wall and I lived life as a bachelor because I didn't want to get hurt. All this changed Tuesday, October 9, 2012. There was something about this girl that peaked my interest. It was funny because I've known her since high school but this was the first time we have spent together one-on-one. I'm not sure if you could call it love at first sight, because it wasn't. But I knew from that day in October, I wanted her. Even before our relationship became a relationship, she mentioned that she was going to move to San Diego. Though we were not in a relationship, I immediately offered myself as her roommate because I didn't want to lose her.</p>
						<p>Courtships was something I grew up as a Filipino so I took her dates, spoiled her with gifts and flowers, not to impress her, but to show her how much I adored her. This all led up to December 4, 2012. I wanted to do something I have never done before. I bought her a necklace to ask her to be my girlfriend. I took her to Lake Las Vegas. After walking around a while... We stumbled upon this dock on the water overlooking the lights dancing in the night sky. I mustered all the courage in me and asked her out. This was one of the happiest and unforgettable moments in my life.</p>
						<p>Fast forward three years to Friday, December 4, 2015, the biggest night of my life. We had planned a trip to Mexico for our third year anniversary. Little did she know that this was the last anniversary they will spend as "boyfriend and girlfriend". Knowing that you are going to propose to the woman of your dreams that day, is very nerve wrecking. I was very nervous and stressed that day. Hiding the ring and making sure she didn't see it was one the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I had a speech that I had prepared, memorized, and practiced for many days making sure it will be perfect for that moment.  During the day, we explored the ship and I was secretly keeping a lookout for the perfect spot and then it hit me. There was a top deck that overlooks the water. It would be perfect under the night sky as a reminder of the first day our relationship started on that dock.</p>
						<p>We had just finished dinner and the anxiety level that I was feeling was over the top. I asked her to walk with me to the top deck that we had previously scouted that morning.  Everything was going according to plan. We were sitting in the lounge chairs and the speech I had prepared was underway. However, nerves got the best of me and my speech was all over the place. I knew that I was messing up, but there was no stopping me. I was on a roll of disaster. During the middle of my speech, we started walking up to the upper deck. This is it I said to myself. I had to end my speech plus a few more that I didn't expect to say. I told her that it would be nice to come back here one day and tell our kids the story of how I proposed to you. I would never forget the expression on her face after I said that. I knelt down with 1 knee and said "Lynne Mendoza, will you marry me?" She cried and nodded. That was the best non-verbal gesture I've gotten from anyone. It made me the happiest guy in the whole wide world.</p>

Since it was our first night on the ship, I didn't want to waste it, so I happily agreed. It was freezing outside, but it was okay because it was beautiful. We had set sail so we were already surrounded by water. Our anniversary weekend was just getting started and I couldn't be more excited. We sat on a couple of lounge chairs on the top deck and looked at the stars. Mikki told me how happy he was to be with me and that <i>"we should be making more memories like this"</i>. He said this several times. 
						</p><p>We decided to walk around a bit and I noticed he kept on repeating that we need to come back and do this again. I replied stating that we could go on all different kinds of cruises. He then told me he loves me once more and that one day we should come back . . . I was about to say, <i>yessss we will</i> (for the tenth time), but he decided to throw me a curve ball and continued, "so we can tell the story to our kids of where I proposed". Mikki got down on one knee and opened a box. I think I teared up and I don't think words made it out of my mouth. But I remember seeing the look on his face. This is the man I'm going to marry.</p>
